A solution for the [Catalysts Coding Contest](https://register.codingcontest.org/) 2014. The goal of the contest was to write an advanced cruise control system for a self driving car.

The exercise uses a java simulator. Your program has to connect via TCP (or console), and has to provide input data for throttle and brake every turn.
